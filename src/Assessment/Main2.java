//	  HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between web servers and web clients (i.e. browsers). 
//
//	  Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser the status of its most recent page request. Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:
//
//	  200, OK (fulfilled)
//	  401, unauthorized
//	  403, forbidden
//	  404, not found
//	  500, server error
//	  otherwise, not supported status code
//
//	  Given an int variable status, write a switch statement that prints out, on a line by itself, the appropriate label from the above list based on status.
