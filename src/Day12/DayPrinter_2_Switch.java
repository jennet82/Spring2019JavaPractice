				/*
				 * Switch VS Ternary VS if else
				 * 
				 * Switch : should be used when checking for equality of certain
				 * variable in multiple specific case Ternary : conditionally assigning
				 * a value . we can not take actions we can only assign value according
				 * to condition If else : most flexible , can do anything
				 * 
				 * use switch statement to accomplish this task
				 * 
				 * declare a int variable dayNum declare a String variable dayWord
				 * 
				 * use switch to check for equality of dayNum 
				 * 
				 * case 1 - 5  ---  assign the value for dayWord as weekdays
				 * case 6 - 7  ---   assign the value for dayWord as weekends
				 *  
				 * 
				 * if nothing match assign value dayWord as invalid day
				 * 
				 * after switch statement -- print out the dayWord value
				 * 
				 * 
				 * HOMEWORK : 
				 *  2 variables : season as String , monthNum as int 
				 * 	Use switch statement to check for monthNumber equality 
				 *  if  3-4-5 as spring 6-7-8 as summer -9-10-11 fall -12,1,2 as winter
				 *
